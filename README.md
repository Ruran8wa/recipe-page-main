## My process

For this project, I began by structuring the HTML using semantic tags, incorporating <div> elements to organize the layout effectively. Utilizing CSS custom properties, I defined variables for colors to maintain consistency and facilitate easy theming throughout the component. Additionally, I enhanced the visual appeal of the project by importing the "Outfit" font from Google Fonts to add a unique typographic touch.

Throughout the styling process, I adhered to a modular approach, leveraging measurements such as multiples of 8 pixels and percentages divisible by 8 for precise and harmonious design. To ensure responsiveness across various devices, I referred to resources such as W3Schools for guidance on implementing media queries effectively.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to structure HTML for a QR code component and style it using CSS. Here are some key takeaways:

Semantic HTML5 markup is essential for accessibility and SEO.
Using CSS custom properties (variables) allows for easier theme management and consistent styling across components.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on the following areas:

- Exploring advanced CSS techniques for layout and design.
- Learning JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality to my projects.

### Useful resources

- MDN Web Docs - (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - A comprehensive resource for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript documentation.
- W3Schools - (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - Another comprehensive resource i used for learning media queries using css.
